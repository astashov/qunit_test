== Description

Generator of javascript files with javascript test files and javascript test
runner in different browsers.

This project was heavily inspired from Dr.Nic's jsunittest project (almost forked),
but uses QUnit javascript testing framework (works with jQuery) and not so 
features-riched as jsunittest.


== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/astashov/qunit_test.git vendor/plugins/qunit_test

or as submodule

  git submodule add git://github.com/astashov/qunit_test.git vendor/plugins/qunit_test


== Using

For creating new javascript file with javascript test file, please execute:

  script/generate javascript_test name_of_lib

It will create files: 
/public/javascripts/name_of_lib.js 
and 
/test/javascripts/name_of_lib_test.html

You should place your test to name_of_lib_test.html file.

For running test in opera, firefox, ie and safari, please execute:

  rake javascript_tests

It will try to run specified browsers, open test files, and send results of
tests to this ruby script.


== Troubleshooting

Sometimes you should close particular browser with test pages to continue testing 
by next browsers.
